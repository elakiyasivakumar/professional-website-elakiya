abstract: "Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death worldwide among women, with good survival rates if detected early. In our work, we compared supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning on the biomedical dataset, Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, to establish the model with the best performance and hence apply for computer-aided diagnosis."
