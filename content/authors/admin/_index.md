    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I hold a Master’s in Biomedical Engineering and Design from Columbia University, where I graduated magna cum laude. My technical experience lies in developing and applying AI models to solve healthcare challenges. Prior to my role at New Markets Advisors, I worked in medical start-ups, focusing on upstream product development and business strategy, as well as gaining business development experience in the biopharma industry. I’ve also held multiple leadership positions, with my favorite being President of SSN Theatre during my undergrad. Currently, I serve on LifeSci NYC’s Alumni Advisory Board, working to strengthen alumni relations and networking opportunities.
