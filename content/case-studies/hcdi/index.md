## Our Story

Every year, thousands of families with infants are affected by flooding, and most of them are unprepared to evacuate safely with their newborn. As designers who are from flood-prone areas of the world, we care deeply about the safety of mothers and their children during a flood. 

There is currently no product for mothers to carry and transport their babies safely in dangerous flooding situations. That’s why we designed Turtle Wrap!  This carrier can be used as a normal carrier on a daily basis, but when a flood hits, it can be converted into a floatation device for the baby. 

## The Problem
- Mothers in the US don’t have a safe way to carry their babies (0-6 months) while evacuating during a flood.

- The US experiences an urban flooding event once every 2-3 days.

- There are currently no products dedicated to keeping infants safe in floods.

## Who are the Stakeholders? 
The stakeholders include the local government and mothers (and some grandmothers)!
We interviewed 8 mothers who live in flood prone areas. 
Their feedback highlighted that even though moms care about their own comfort and safety, it was always the safety and comfort of their baby was of the highest importance.

Potential customers:

Mothers who live in flood-prone areas that don’t want/need to evacuate but still want to be prepared.

## What do Moms want from a safe transportation device for their babies? 

- Need the product to be waterproof to protect the baby from the flood.
- Want hands-free options for practicality.
- Want to be physically attached to the baby to feel safe.
- Need the product to be portable and light in case of an emergency.
- Want to be able to use the product in everyday life.
- Need an affordable solution (less than $100).
