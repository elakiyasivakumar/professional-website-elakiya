## Our Story

Every year, thousands of families with infants are affected by flooding, and most of them are unprepared to evacuate safely with their newborn. As designers who are from flood-prone areas of the world, we care deeply about the safety of mothers and their children during a flood. 

There is currently no product for mothers to carry and transport their babies safely in dangerous flooding situations. That’s why we designed Turtle Wrap!  This carrier can be used as a normal carrier on a daily basis, but when a flood hits, it can be converted into a floatation device for the baby. 

## turtle wrap 
- Mothers in the US don’t have a safe way to carry their babies (0-6 months) while evacuating during a flood.

- The US experiences an urban flooding event once every 2-3 days.

- There are currently no products dedicated to keeping infants safe in floods.
