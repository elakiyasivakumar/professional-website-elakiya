# Hospitals Lose $15M every year because surgeons develop extreme musculoskeletal pain. 
Surgeons develop musculoskeletal issues from straining long hours in awkward positions while operating on patients. This can cost hospitals an estimated $15M in loss each year (based on our estimations). 

Surgeons have the highest rate of work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders:
      - 8 in 10 surgeons experience chronic back/neck pain
      - >76% of surgeons report not having any ergonomic training
      - >$15M hospital expenditure for MSD-Sick leave & sabbaticals
      - 1 in 5 surgeons plan to retire early as result of physical toll
  
## Creating the solution...

We spoke to 30 surgical residents at Columbia Presbyterian and some more Ergonomic experts from all over the world to understand the problem. Surgeons need a metric to understand what their body goes through during a procedure.

We created an AI driven real-time video analysis tool that “watches” surgeons while they perform the surgery and gives them “visual” feedback during or after the surgery (because they are busy!)

Our model was able to reach better compliance than existing methods in a self-reported survey by surgeons. They found it more “usable” and easy to follow during the surgery

I led the stakeholder interviews for the team and defaulted into product design and distribution strategy simply because I knew the population I was designing for. 

## In the Market:

![InSim Surgical](comp.png)

the current support for surgeons only includes “breaks” (Mayo clinic) and “PT help”. Moreover most surgical environments and instruments are not designed for women or peope of color leading to a severe lack of workplace ergonomics. 

Solutions like TuMeke are not caliberated for surgical procedures and are not able to offer excercise recommendations to surgeons.

## Go to Market Strategy 

### Regulatory 

#### FDA 
FDA Designation as DeNovo Class 2 Medical Device

#### HIPAA 
Data Security and Patient Privacy Regulations need to be adhered 

#### Partenrships

Industry and Commercial: 
- Med-tech companies  focused in surgical ergonomics like Intuitive, J&J
- Workplace insurance companies for hospitals 
- Surgical Ergonomists 
Aim to make InSim the top measuring tool for good ergonomics with devices and postures

Clinical Bodies: 
- Mayo Clinic is a pioneer in the US for surgical ergonomics 
- ACS (American College of Surgeons) 
- ACGME (American Council for Graduate Medical Education)  
Aim to make ‘good posture’ a training metric for surgeons.

### Defining Success Metrics: "Usability"

How easy do surgeons find it to use solution? How much set up is required? Ease of remembering and adopting solution in OR.

###Defining Success Metrics: Future Phases
In the upcoming phases using a mix of quantitative and qualitative data is vital. This also forms the basis for the Pre-Market Approval (PMA) submissions. 

Quantitative:
- Frequency of use
- Improvement in Posture over Set period (for an X population) 
- Improvement in clinical outcomes

Qualitative:
- Ease of Use
- Perceived Effectiveness


### Iterative Device Improvement: to Phase 1

Using principles of Human Centered Design to understand “what do the users want” in the device. 
Notifications were a key concern for surgeons and residents  due to the amount of “distractions” and “disruptions” in their schedule.

### Key takeaways: 

- The surgical population is a unique user population to design for. They are busy, they have too much paper work, they simply cannot “learn” more and prioritize.
- surgeon’s mindset: instruments are for patient outcomes and not for physician comfort - which means anything we design, like a operating table that can adjust its height or a new light etc may have a harder time getting into the OR.
- We wanted to give the surgeons the power - we wanted to show them what they go through in a quantifiable manner and they do what they think is necessary to maintain ergonomics, this could be “learning” and “practicing” with the right posture or this could be doing counteractive stretches after surgeries. We prioritize visual feedback!
